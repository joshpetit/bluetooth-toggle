# Bluetooth Toggle
This is a short shell script that creates a command to toggle bluetooth on/off
along with a notification everytime it is toggled. Requires bluetoothctl.

## Instillation
`git clone https://github.com/joshpetit/bluetooth-toggle.git`
`cd bluetooth-toggle`
`chmod +x bluetoothtoggle`

## Running
`./path/to/dir/bluetoothtoggle`

I recommend going to your settings and adding a keyboard shortcut that will
run the script.
